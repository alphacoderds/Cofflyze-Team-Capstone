# Cofflyze - Final Capstone Project 2024
Cofflyze is an Android-based application that aims to help coffee farmers diagnose diseases in coffee plants through leaf analysis. This application is designed to overcome the problem of early detection of coffee leaf diseases, which are often difficult for farmers to recognize visually and have a significant impact on crop yields. Based on research questions related to the effectiveness of leaf scanning in identifying coffee plant diseases, Cofflyze uses image processing and machine learning technology to identify four leaf conditions: miner,phoma , rust, and no disease.
